## Introduction

**Gurak the Messenger Bot** is a custom Discord bot designed to manage VIP subscriptions, user presence tracking, tag management, and provides a custom help command. It is structured with a modular architecture, using multiple cogs for various features, making it extensible and easy to maintain.

## Features

- **VIP Management**: Adds, removes, and lists VIP subscriptions, allowing administrators to manage VIP statuses with automated role assignments.
- **Presence Tracking**: Tracks user online presence for role promotion based on activity.
- **Tag Management**: Allows users with the appropriate permissions to assign tags to others, useful for organizing users by roles or other criteria.
- **Custom Help Command**: Provides a comprehensive help command that groups available commands by category.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Logs errors and activities, with retries for certain actions if permissions are denied.
